| Filter so you specify generation or type. | High     | 2 hrs         | Sort the list by types (Example grass/poison) | Dropdown menu to filter between either 1 or 2 types. | It will be very difficult to browse the page without it. |
| First 3 generations a pokedex. | Medium     | 4 hrs         | Display the first 386 pokemon (including special forms?) on the page. | Using the API to get the data and then displaying it onto the page. | So there is something on the page. |
| Pixel art for the old versions. | Low     | 2 hrs         | Display the older sprites of that specific pokemon if they are availible. | Get the old sprites out of the API and display them on a section of the page. | See how the old sprites looked in older games compared to the new ones. |
| An info page to make it user friendly just so the user knows where it can do what. | High     | 2 hrs         | Give info for stuff like what you can see. | Info page | To get a bit of an idea of the website. |
| An easy to use place where you can type pokemon typing and then it wil show you what types are super effective or weak against. | Medium   | 8 hrs         | Type in a type (example grass) and see what types do super effective damage, not very effective damage or have no effect. | Seperate tab for that info (and maybe also on a pokemon his page). | To see type effectiveness. |
